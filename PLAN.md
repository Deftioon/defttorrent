Collecting workspace informationBelow is a high-level plan outlining how you can build a torrenting client in Rust with Tauri, with clear separation between the frontend, backend, and the middle layer:

---

### 1. Frontend (React with Tauri)

- **User Interface:**  
  Build your UI using React. You already have a starting point in App.tsx. Extend the UI to allow users to:
  - Select/upload a torrent file.
  - Display torrent details (name, files, download progress).
  - Show peer lists and connection status.
  
- **Interactivity:**  
  - Use React state to hold torrent status.
  - Call Tauri commands (defined in the backend) to start, pause, or cancel downloads.
  - Create additional pages or views (e.g., a page for detailed torrent info) similar to SecondPage.tsx.

### 2. Backend (Rust Torrent Logic)

- **Torrent File Parsing:**  
  Enhance your torrent file parser in parser.rs and mod.rs to fully support single-file and multi-file torrents. These modules should:
  - Read and parse the .torrent file.
  - Verify info hash calculation.
  - Extract metadata (announce URL, file list, piece length, and pieces).

- **Tracker Communication:**  
  The module in tracker.rs already shows how you might connect and announce to a tracker. Expand it to:
  - Handle different tracker protocols (UDP/TCP).
  - Retry connections or handle failures appropriately.
  
- **Download Management:**  
  - Create a downloading service in Rust that coordinates piece selection, requests, and reassembly.
  - Manage peer connections and piece validation.
  - Use async tasks (with Tokio) to run downloads concurrently.

---

### 3. Middle Layer (Orchestration between Frontend and Backend)

- **Command Layer:**  
  - In lib.rs, implement additional Tauri commands that wrap your torrent operations (start, pause, resume, and status check).  
  - For example, create a command that triggers the torrent download process in the backend and returns progress updates.  
  - You can use the existing command `greet` as a pattern.

- **State Management & Messaging:**  
  - Maintain global torrent download state on the backend.  
  - Use Tauri’s event system to push updates to the frontend as the download progresses (e.g., progress percentage, peer list updates).

- **Integration:**  
  - The middle layer will call backend functions (parsers and tracker requests) and expose these functionalities to the React UI via Tauri commands.
  - Consider creating a dedicated module, such as `torrent_manager.rs`, to encapsulate orchestration logic (initialization, status updates, error handling).

### Example Workflow

1. **User selects a torrent file** in the React UI (src/App.tsx).  
2. **Frontend sends a Tauri command** to load the torrent file.  
3. **Command handler in Rust** (in src-tauri/src/lib.rs) calls the torrent parser (from src-tauri/src/backend/mod.rs) to extract metadata.  
4. **Torrent manager** starts the download process by:
   - Getting a connection via the tracker (src-tauri/src/requests/tracker.rs).
   - Scheduling piece downloads using async tasks.
5. **Backend sends periodic events** to the frontend (using Tauri events) with updates such as download progress and peer information.
6. **UI updates** to reflect the current download status.

This plan leverages your existing workspace structure and divides responsibilities in a clear, maintainable way. You can start by fleshing out each piece progressively and then integrate them using Tauri’s robust communication system.

Happy coding!
